--Type that line into your SQL editor in SQLite. What columns are in the customers table? order_id / acctnum
--Now do the same thing but take a look at the JanSales table instead of the customers table. What columns are in that one? 
--order_id / Product / Quantity / price / orderdate / location

---#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT orderID, COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales ;
ANSWER orderID	COUNT(*)
---------141234	9723

--#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT orderID, Count(*) FROM  BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product = 'iPhone';
--Answer 379

--#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid

--#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? For this one, you are going to use the commands distinct and MIN(). Using 'SELECT distinct' 
--will remove duplicate rows from your results. The MIN() command will allow you to select the smallest value from the price column. This is a hard one -
 --see if you can do it, but don't be afraid to look at the hint or answer if you need to!
 
SELECT MIN(Price), product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales; 
ANSWER MIN(Price)	product
2.99	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

---#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

--#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity),product,SUM(quantity)*(price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location ='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';
SUM(quantity)	product	SUM(quantity) * (price)

--ANSWER 2	AA Batteries (4-pack)	7.68

--#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT 
count(cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
