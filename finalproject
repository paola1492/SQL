SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers WHERE Country != 'USA' ORDER BY Country;

--#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.customers WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT INV.InvoiceId, CUS.FirstName, CUS.LastName, INV.InvoiceDate, INV.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers CUS JOIN invoices INV ON INV.CustomerId=CUS.CustomerId

--#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT Distinct BillingCountry
FROM invoices ORDER BY BillingCountry;

--#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT EMP.FirstName, Emp.LastName, Inv.InvoiceId
FROM employees EMP 
JOIN customers CUS ON CUS.SupportRepid=EMP.employeeId
JOIN invoices INV ON INV.CustomerId=CUS.CustomerId

--#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT (InvoiceId)
FROM invoices WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT ROUND (SUM (Total),3)
FROM invoices WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
